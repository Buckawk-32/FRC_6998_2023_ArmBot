# FRC_6998_2023_ARM_ROBOT
This is the robot code for the robot arm that will be showcased in June 10th in Tainan City Hall, by FRC 6998 team

## Description
This is the code for the side robot that our frc team had built. It uses the swerve base from our senior, and I added the arm functionality.

### Parts
1. Swerve Subsystem
   - Each module has 1 Neo Motor for changing the angle and 1 Falcon 500 Motor for increasing speed
2. Arm Subsystem
   - The Arm has a back arm and forearm
     - The back arm is controlled by a 200 : 1 gear ratio with a Neo
     - The fore arm is controlled by a 80 : 1 gear ratio with a Neo
   - The Intake
     - It is a rotating intake with a belt that takes in cubes and cones

## News
Sadly the mostly likely won't be tested, as the robot is under maintanice in the FRC team and the robot has been recycled
